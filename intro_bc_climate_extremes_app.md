#### **Overview: DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT **
 The BC climate extremes app aims to provide insights into extreme climate indices across British Columbia (BC) and its sub-regions (eco-provinces and major watersheds). This tool provides over 50 extreme climate indices outlined and developed through the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Commission for Climatology (CCl) Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI). All the indices were calculated using the Climpact software , a publicly available R based software that heavily uses the R packages  <a href= 'https://pacificclimate.github.io/climdex.pcic/'> climdex.pcic </a>  and <a href= 'https://pacificclimate.github.io/climdex.pcic.ncdf/' > climdex.pcic.ncdf</a> as its core for calculating indices. 
 The <a href='https://ccrc-extremes.shinyapps.io/climpact/'> Climpact software </a> provides details of the indices and their calculation process. Bwlowvis a brief summary table of the indices calculated.
 
 We used daily minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation from <a href='https://www.gloh2o.org/mswx/'> MSWX daily data </a> to calculate the extreme indices for the period of 1979 -2023. The MSWX data is <<<<describe >>>
 
**Table 1: List of the extreme indices calculated with their descriptions. Table is copied from <a href='https://github.com/ARCCSS-extremes/climpact/blob/master/www/user_guide/Climpact_user_guide.md'> Climpact Github page </a>.Bold indicates indices also recommended by the ETCCDI. **
