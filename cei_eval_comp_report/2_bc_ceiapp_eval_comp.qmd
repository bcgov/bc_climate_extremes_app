# Background

This document presents an evaluation of selected **Climate Extremes Indices (CEIs)** generated and visualized in the <a href="https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/bc_climate_extremes_app/" target="_blank"> `bc_climate_extremes_app` </a> (referred to as **CEIapp** hereafter). The primary objectives are twofold:

1.  To clarify the calculation methods for specific CEIs whose definitions or computational procedures are not sufficiently detailed in their definition and description [Appendix 1](#appendix1)
2.  To assess the consistency and performance of CEIs produced by the app in comparison with similar indices from established sources or input data.

The <a href="https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/bc_climate_extremes_app/" target="_blank"> CEIapp </a> provides a suite of over 70 CEIs, derived from the Multi-Source Weather <a href="https://www.gloh2o.org/mswx/" target="_blank"> (MSWX) </a> gridded dataset [@Beck2022], which includes daily minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation across western North America. Several CEIs also incorporate spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) and the month of the year in their calculations to account for spatial and seasonal variability. This dataset has a spatial resolution of **0.1° × 0.1°** and spans the period from **1979 to present**. For the current analysis, we limit the temporal extent to **2024**, the most recent year for which complete data were available. The app will be updated periodically to incorporate indices for subsequent years.

Although the app includes over 70 CEIs (listed in [Appendix 1](#appendix-1)), the scope of this evaluation is limited to a subset of sector-relevant indices, as many of the indices are already well-defined and sufficiently described. Selected indices evaluated here include the **drought index SPEI**, the **heatwave-related indices**, and the **precipitation-related indices**.

# Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)

We calculated the **Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)** drought index using the <a href="https://github.com/ARCCSS-extremes/climpact" target="-blank"> climpact R package </a>, which internally uses the <a href="https://github.com/sbegueria/SPEI"> SPEI R package </a> to compute SPEI values. The SPEI is calculated as the climatic water balance obtained at various time scales (here: 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month) as shown in equation (i) [@Vicente-Serrano2010]:

$$
D_i = P_i - PET_i                            \tag{i}
$$

where:\
$P_i$ is the accumulated precipitation for period *i*,\
$PET_i$ is the potential evapotranspiration, and\
$D_i$ is the climate water balance.

The time series of $D_i$ values is then standardized (mean 0, standard deviation 1) using a log-logistic distribution to produce unitless SPEI values [@Vicente-Serrano2010]. These standardized values account for seasonal and regional variability, enabling comparison across time and space.

There are various methods to calculate PET, such as Thornthwaite, Penman-Monteith, and Hargreaves. In the **CEIapp**, the $PET ( ET_0 )$ is calculated using a modified Hargreaves method, an empirical approach that requires limited input data and relies primarily on temperature and extraterrestrial radiation (Ra), which can be calculated from latitude and Julian day as in equation (ii).

$$
ET_o = 0.0023 \times Ra \times (T_{avg} + 17.8) \times (T_{max} - T_{min})^{0.5}                         \tag{ii}
$$

where:\
$ET_0$ = evapotranspiration,\
$Ra$ = extraterrestrial radiation,\
$T_{avg}$, $T_{max}$, $T_{min}$ = average, maximum, and minimum daily temperatures.

The calculated SPEI can be used to indicate the severity of drought with negative and positive SPEI indicating dry and wet conditions as in @tbl-drght_cond:

| SPEI Value     | Drought Condition |
|----------------|-------------------|
| ≤ -2.00        | Extremely Dry     |
| -1.50 to -1.99 | Severely Dry      |
| -1.00 to -1.49 | Moderately Dry    |
| -0.99 to 0.99  | Normal            |
| 1.00 to 1.49   | Moderately Wet    |
| 1.50 to 1.99   | Very Wet          |
| ≥ 2.00         | Extremely Wet     |

: **Categories of drought condition based on SPEI values.** {#tbl-drght_cond}

We compared our SPEI values with those from the **global SPEI database**, which provides long-term SPEI data (1950–2025) at **1° × 1°** spatial resolution using the **CRU TS 4.09** dataset (Harris et al., 2020). This database provides SPEI for accumulation periods ranging from 1 to 48 months. For our comparison, we focused on **3-, 6-, and 12-month periods** using a BC subset of the global dataset.

@fig-speijl2023 shows a spatial comparison of SPEI across BC at three temporal scales—3, 6, and 12 months— for July 2023, one of the highest drought months. The figure indicates detailed drought conditions as shown by SPEI with the higher resolution outputs of the CEIapp (left panel) than the coarser-resolution global SPEI ( right panel). Although the pattern of SPEI is captured well across BC especially for 3-months period, it differs substantially for 6 and 12 months especially along the Coast Mountains region of BC. Furthermore, the SPEI calculated for CEIapp consistently indicates widespread drought conditions across BC for all three accumulation periods (3, 6, and 12 months). Drought severity intensifies with increasing accumulation periods, a pattern particularly evident in the 12-month SPEI map (@fig-speijl2023 a), which depicts pervasive drought throughout the province. In contrast, the global SPEI dataset exhibits greater spatial variability, with certain regions not indicating drought. While the SPEI from CEIapp suggests a more uniform and widespread drought pattern, the global SPEI database illustrates localized areas—particularly along the western coast—where drought conditions are less pronounced or absent in the global SPEI data. Given the inherently regional nature of drought, the extreme app’s SPEI appears to provide a more consistent and regionally appropriate representation of drought conditions in BC compared to the global dataset.

![Spatial pattern of 3, 6 and 12-month SPEI calculated from (a.) MSWX based CEI database from the bc_climate_extremes_app and (b.) using global drought monitor database for July 2023.](cei_eval_results_plts_tbls/bc_july2023_mswx_global_spei.png){#fig-speijl2023 width="100%"}

We also calculated **correlation** and other comparison metrics—including **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Integrated Quadratic Distance (IQD)** which quantifies the difference between two distribution functions by integrating the squared differences across their range (@Thorarinsdottir2013) —between the extreme app’s SPEI and the global SPEI datasets. These metrics assess the degree of agreement and error between the SPEIs from the CEIapp and global SPEI database.

The 3-month accumulation of the SPEI shows higher correlation and lower RMSE and IQD between the extreme app and global SPEI datasets (@fig-speicompcoef_plt). This indicates relatively strong agreement at shorter accumulation timescales. However, as the accumulation period increases (e.g., to 6 or 12 months), the correlation weakens and error metrics increase, suggesting greater discrepancies between the datasets. This divergence i.e, the reduced comparability of SPEI values at longer accumulation periods, is likely attributable to differences in dataset resolution and quality (MSWX (0.1°) @Beck2022 versus CRU TS (1°) @Harris2020) and methodological variations in PET estimation (CEIapp uses Hargreaves; global datasets may use Thornthwaite or Penman-Monteith) .

# Heatwave and temperature indices

We calculated the heatwave number, frequency and duration using the climpact R package and the heatwave aspects are defined based on minimum and maximum temperature thresholds and the Excess Heat Factor (EHF). The maximum (minimum) temperature heatwaves are defined as any period of three or more days when daily maximum (minimum) temperature ((TX)(TN)) exceeds the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile for the corresponding calendar day. EHF heatwaves are defined as any period of three or more days when the EHF is positive. The EHF is calculated as in equation (iii) where $EHI_{sig}$ and $EHI_{acc}$ are two excess heat indices (EHI) representing the potential to acclimatize to and the climatological significance of the heat on a particular day and calculated as in equations (iv) and (v) following @Nairn2013.

$$
 EHF = EHI_{sig} \times EHI_{acc}                     \tag{iii}
$$

$$
EHI_{sig} = (T_{i} + T_{i-1} + T_{i-2})/3 - T_{95}                \tag{iv}
$$ $$
EHI_{acc} = (T_{i} + T_{i-1} + T_{i-2})/3 - (T_{i-1} + ...+ T_{i-30})/30                \tag{v}
$$

where $T_i$ is the daily temperature for day $i$ and $T_{95}$ is the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of $T_i$ over all days within the specified base period i.e., 1981-2010. Since heatwave indices are directly derived from daily minimum and maximum temperatures, we first evaluate the MSWX daily temperature data against observed station data across BC. This comparison serves to assess the representativeness of the MSWX dataset, and the reliability of the heatwave indices computed in the CEIapp. We focus on two key comparisons: (1) the 2021 heatwave event, one of the most significant in BC’s recent history and (2) a long-term evaluation across three stations located at different elevations and different parts of BC. These analyses provide insights into how accurately MSWX data captures daily temperature, and, by extension, the robustness of heatwave-related indices presented in the CEIapp.

## Heatwave 2021

@fig-hwbc_plt (for all of BC) and @fig-hwbclw_plt (focused on lower-latitude regions of BC) provide a visual comparison of how daily minimum and maximum temperatures were captured by the MSWX daily temperature data relative to observed station data during the peak of the June 2021 heatwave (June 25 to July 2, 2021). Overall, the MSWX data shows strong agreement with observations, with an average difference of only 0.2°C for maximum temperatures and –1.5°C for minimum temperatures across all stations.

## Long-term daily temperature evaluation

: **Comparison coefficients between observed and MSWX data for the period of 1980 to 2024 across selected three stations in BC.** {#tbl-compcoeftmp}

A long-term comparison of daily MSWX and observed temperature from three selected stations in BC spanning a range of elevations (@fig-stnlocmap) over the period 1980 to 2024 demonstrates good agreement between these two datasets (@tbl-compcoeftmp and @fig-1on1tmpplt). Correlation coefficients *(r)* are consistently strong for both Tmin (0.93) and Tmax (0.95) on average. Average MAE values are 2.12 for Tmin and 2.25 for Tmax, indicating good accuracy. While minor biases exist, the overall consistency and low IQD values suggest the MSWX daily temperature is reliable for heatwave indices.

![One on one plot of daily temperature between MSWX and observation for selected 3 stations covering different elevations across BC.](cei_eval_results_plts_tbls/oneonone_bc_sel_stns_dly_tmp_obs_mswx_plt.png){#fig-1on1tmpplt width="100%"}

The 1:1 scatter plot of both minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) temperatures shows that the MSWX temperatures closely align with observation, as indicated by the tight clustering of points around the 1:1 line (@fig-1on1tmpplt). This strong linear agreement suggests that MSWX effectively captures daily temperature variability and extremes across different elevations and regions. Despite minor discrepancies, especially at lower temperatures for station 1095018, the overall consistency underscores the reliability of MSWX for representing historical daily temperature and their extremes.

These results, based on both the detailed comparison of the 2021 heatwave and the long-term evaluation, indicate that the MSWX dataset reliably represents extreme temperature conditions. Consequently, the heatwave indices derived from the CEI app can be considered a reliable representation of heatwave conditions in BC.

# Precipitation and precipitation indices

Further, we compared daily precipitation and precipitation-related climate extreme indices—R20mm (days with precipitation ≥ 20 mm) and PRCPTOT (annual total precipitation). The MSWX gridded data generally aligns with the observed station data in terms of the timing and frequency of daily precipitation events aligning visually with observed wet and dry periods (@fig-prcplinplt) however there is consistent underestimation of observed high magnitude precipitation events (@fig-prcp1on1plt). Moreover, there is generally poor correlation and negative bias on daily precipitation for higher elevation stations (@tbl-compcoefprcp).

| Station ID | MAE   | RMSE  | Bias   | Corr (r) | IQD   |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| 1095018    | 1.730 | 3.470 | -0.010 | 0.370    | 0.016 |

: **Comparison coefficients between observed and MSWX daily precipitation data from 1980 to 2024 at three selected stations in BC.** {#tbl-compcoefprcp}

Moreover, a one-to-one comparison of observed station data and MSWX-derived values for two precipitation-related climate indices—R20mm (number of days with precipitation ≥ 20 mm) and PRCPTOT (annual total wet-day precipitation)—shows that MSWX generally agrees with station-based indices at lower elevation sites (@fig-prcpindx1on1plt). However, at the higher elevation station (e.g., EAC), and particularly for higher-magnitude precipitation values, MSWX tends to underestimate both total precipitation and R20mm reinforcing what was observed in the comparison of the daily precipitation data highlighting MSWX’s limitations in accurately capturing extreme precipitation indices, especially in complex topographic regions.

# Summary

This report provides a preliminary assessment of how well CEIs derived from the MSWX dataset represent climate extremes in BC and offers guidance to users on how to interpret and apply results from the CEIapp. Based on the analysis of SPEI, heatwave events, and precipitation-related indices, the following conclusions can be drawn:

-   **SPEI Performance:** Although the 3-month SPEI values are comparable between the CEIapp and global SPEI database, the CEIapp-based SPEI shows greater spatial detail and better alignment with regional drought patterns. It also performs more consistently across longer accumulation periods (6- and 12-month), making it a more accurate representation of drought conditions in BC compared to the global SPEI datasets.

-   **Heatwave and temperature extremes:** The MSWX daily temperature data effectively captures the extreme 2021 heatwave, with only a 0.5°C difference in mean maximum temperatures compared to observed station data. Long-term temperature also shows good agreement, indicating that MSWX reliably represents heatwave and temperature-related extremes conditions across the province.

-   **Precipitation Indices:** While MSWX captures the temporal evolution of daily precipitation fairly well at lower magnitudes, it tends to underestimate high-magnitude precipitation events, especially in higher elevations. As a result, precipitation-related CEIs derived from MSWX are only moderately representative and should be used with caution, particularly when analyzing extremes or localized heavy precipitation events.

This evaluation and comparison of CEIs and the input data used to calculate them in the CEIapp offer an initial level of confidence and insight into the (un)certainty of how well MSWX-based CEIs are represented. It aims to give users information on how they might want to approach the data and results from the CEIapp. However, it is important to note that this evaluation is based on a limited number of selected stations and may not fully represent the broader spatial performance across BC. A more comprehensive assessment across additional stations and regions is beyond the scope of this work. Users should use this as a guidance and exercise their own discretion when interpreting and utilizing the data and results provided by the CEIapp.
