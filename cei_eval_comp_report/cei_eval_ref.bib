abstract = {It has been argued persuasively that, in order to evaluate climate models, the probability distributions of model output need to be compared to the corresponding empirical distributions of observed data. Distance measures between probability distributions, also called divergence functions, can be used for this purpose. We contend that divergence functions ought to be proper, in the sense that acting on modelers' true beliefs is an optimal strategy. The score divergences introduced in this paper derive from proper scoring rules and, thus, they are proper with the integrated quadratic distance and the Kullback–Leibler divergence being particularly attractive choices. Other commonly used divergences fail to be proper. In an illustration, we evaluate and rank simulations from 15 climate models for temperature extremes in a comparison to reanalysis data.},

@article{Harris2020,
abstract = {CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) is a widely used climate dataset on a 0.5° latitude by 0.5° longitude grid over all land domains of the world except Antarctica. It is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations. Here we describe the construction of a major new version, CRU TS v4. It is updated to span 1901–2018 by the inclusion of additional station observations, and it will be updated annually. The interpolation process has been changed to use angular-distance weighting (ADW), and the production of secondary variables has been revised to better suit this approach. This implementation of ADW provides improved traceability between each gridded value and the input observations, and allows more informative diagnostics that dataset users can utilise to assess how dataset quality might vary geographically.},

@article{Beck2022,
abstract = {We present Multi-Source Weather (MSWX), a seamless global gridded near-surface meteorological product featuring a high 3-hourly 0.1 resolution, near-real-time updates ($\sim$3-h latency), and bias-corrected medium-range (up to 10 days) and long-range (up to 7 months) forecast ensembles. The product includes 10 meteorological variables: precipitation, air temperature, daily minimum and maximum air temperature, surface pressure, relative and specific humidity, wind speed, and downward shortwave and longwave radiation. The historical part of the record starts 1 January 1979 and is based on ERA5 data bias corrected and downscaled using high-resolution reference climatologies. The data extension to within $\sim$3 h of real time is based on analysis data from GDAS. The 30-member medium-range forecast ensemble is based on GEFS and updated daily. Finally, the 51-member long-range forecast ensemble is based on SEAS5 and updated monthly. The near-real-time and forecast data are statistically harmonized using running-mean and cumulative distribution function-matching approaches to obtain a seamless record covering 1 January 1979 to 7 months from now. MSWX presents new and unique opportunities for hydrological modeling, climate analysis, impact studies, and monitoring and forecasting of droughts, floods, and heatwaves (within the bounds of the caveats and limitations discussed herein). The product is available at www.gloh2o.org/mswx.},

@article{Vicente-Serrano2010,
abstract = {The authors propose a new climatic drought index: the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The SPEI is based on precipitation and temperature data, and it has the advantage of combining multiscalar character with the capacity to include the effects of temperature variability on drought assessment. The procedure to calculate the index is detailed and involves a climatic water balance, the accumulation of deficit/surplus at different time scales, and adjustment to a log-logistic probability distribution. Mathematically, the SPEI is similar to the standardized precipitation index (SPI), but it includes the role of temperature. Because the SPEI is based on a water balance, it can be compared to the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI). Time series of the three indices were compared for a set of observatories with different climate characteristics, located in different parts of the world. Under global warming conditions, only the sc-PDSI and SPEI identified an increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration. Relative to the sc-PDSI, the SPEI has the advantage of being multiscalar, which is crucial for drought analysis and monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},
